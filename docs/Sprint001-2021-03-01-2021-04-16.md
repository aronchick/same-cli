Goals for Sprint #1: 2021-03-01 - 2020-04-16 
-	Here’s the layers of the problem space (for this sprint)


-	Here’s what we’re trying to tackle right now
    - Local getting started
    - Local editing and issue PR to cloud
    - Move from local to cloud with no code changes

*	Here’s a demo showing it working
    - Pre-req:
        - User operating on a POSIX system that supports bash
        - K3s must be supported
        - User must be logged in with a cloud (Azure or Google)
    - User sees a repo she likes and wants to repro it locally
      - She forks the repo
      - She installs SAME from her forked repo
      - She then `init`s her environment (just local)
      - She then `create`s" the program locally
        - It notifies her the pipeline requires storage and creates it (???)
      - She then `run`s the program locally and sees a result
        - She looks at the result (via CLI?)
        - The weights are downloaded to a local directory (?) with the appropriate SHA (?)
      - She opens a jupyter notebook (?)
        - She makes a change to the pipeline (that has a syntax error)
        - She re-runs and it gives her a helpful error message
        - She fixes and re-runs - it results in better performance (?)
      - She then decides to switch to the cloud
        - She changes her environment to "aks"
        - She reruns `init`
        - She reruns `create` - notifies her about disk and creates it
        - She reruns `run` - sees much better/faster performance
      - She commits and pushes back to her repo
      - She does a PR to the original repo
*	Here’s how to download and try it yourself
    - Install instructions (no build required)
    - 5 experimental pipelines you can run against
      - Try them locally
      - Try them in the cloud
      - File bugs
